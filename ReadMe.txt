In the year 2013, man mined a strange rock that has unusual properties.
Like magnets they apply attactive forces on most metals, but unlike the usual magnets we are familiar with,
broken pieces of the mystical rock apply an outward force between them.

These only have 1 magnetic pole instead of two and came to be known as UNIPOLES!

The game :
1) Each level will be a square board, with cells containing metals that the unipoles need to be next to - horizontally or vertically (diagonal doesn't count)
2) Player is to place unipoles in the board to satisfy the total unipole sum in rows and columns.
3) Unipoles may not be placed next to each other - horizontally, vertically or diagonally.
